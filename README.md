# Photo Editor

## A fully functional free online Photo Editor

### What's that?

    Photo[ Editor can be considered as a showcase of various tech. It is a Vue SPA utilizing
    [Buefy](https://buefy.org/) canvas filters and
    [Cropperjs](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropperjs).

    All in all, it's a fun hobby project!

### Usage

    Just upload a photo a start tweaking the sliders! Currently, there are 3 basic editing options:

    * applying [canvas filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/filter) (same as css filters: brightness, saturation, hue rotate, contrast, opacity, grayscale, sepia, invert)

    * applying instagram filters thanks to [Instagram.css](https://github.com/picturepan2/instagram.css)

    * cropping and rotating thanks to [Cropperjs](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropperjs)

### Cotributing

    Certainly, contributions are welcome. So if you'd like to add functionality or simply make it better, go ahead!
    These are the early days of this project so bugs are more than probable and some features may lack. I recommend raising an issue/PR before doing anything.
