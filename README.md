# Photo Editor

## A fully functional free online Photo Editor

### What's that?

Photo Editor can be considered as a showcase of various tech. It is a Vue SPA utilizing [Buefy](https://buefy.org/), canvas filters and [Cropperjs](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropperjs).

All in all, it's a fun hobby project!

### Usage

Just upload a photo a start tweaking the sliders! Currently, there are 3basic editing options:
* applying [canvas filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI/CanvasRenderingContext2D/filter) (same as css filters: brightness,saturation, hue rotate, contrast, opacity, grayscale, sepia, invert)
* applying instagram filters thanks to [Instagram.css](https://githubcom/picturepan2/instagram.css)
* cropping and rotating thanks to [Cropperjs](https://github.comfengyuanchen/cropperjs)
